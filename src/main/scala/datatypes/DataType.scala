 * As of the moment this is a useless trait.
 *
 * All of the types of data that are implemented
 * extend this, so any future utility methods that
 * apply to add data types should be declared here
 * first.
 *
 * All classes that extend this trait should have
 * two helper methods for every parameter, one private
 * and one public.
 *
 * This should work to reduce any cyclical problems that
 * might be found when certain data are not
 * declared
